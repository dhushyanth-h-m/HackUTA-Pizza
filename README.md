# HackUTA-Pizza
At Zero Hunger campaign, we are dedicated to addressing the pressing issue of excess food supply from groceries and restaurants. Our mission is simple: reduce food waste and combat hunger. We connect businesses willing to share surplus food with individuals and families who can benefit from it, offering affordable meals and even the option for businesses to donate food for free. With our platform, we're not just reducing waste; we're fostering a sense of community, where everyone has a role to play in making a positive impact. Join us in creating a world where excess food becomes a solution, helping both the environment and those in need
